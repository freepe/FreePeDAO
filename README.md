- Random Professional users can audit the Solutions and examine the total cost with notation of total work performed. 
- Then Regular along with Random users can decide which Solution is better implemented using market of predictions. 
- Professional and Expert of best Solution receive a FreePenny that is being generated using Proof-of-Commit algorithm.
