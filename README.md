# FreePeDAO
### Decentralized Autonomous Organization "Free People"


##### The Idea
- Regular users will be able to create any tasks, so other Regular users could set the priotities using crowdfunding voting. 
- Professional users can perform tasks and commit the Solution for expertise with notation of total cost of the work performed. 
- Random Expert users can audit the Solutions and examine the total cost with notation of total cost of the work performed. 
- Then Regular users could verify which work is better implemented using market of predictions by voting for the solution. 
- After verification every participant user receive a FreePenny that is being generated using Proof-of-Commit algorithm.
- Regular Users who has voted for Solution that had been selected by the majority receives ether of the other parties.
- Users can exchange Ether, FreePenny and potentially any other coins or fiat money using the P2P Exchanger algorithm.
