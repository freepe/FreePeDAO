- Professional users can perform tasks and commit the Solution for expertise with notation of total work performed. 
- Random Professional users can audit the Solutions and examine the total cost with notation of total work performed. 
- Then Regular along with Random users can decide which Solution is better implemented using market of predictions. 
- Professional and Expert of best Solution receive a FreePenny that is being generated using Proof-of-Commit algorithm.
- Regular Users who has voted for Solution that had been selected by the majority receives ether of the other parties.
- Users can exchange Ether, FreePenny and potentially any other coins or fiat money using the P2P Exchanger algorithm.
- Users can start crowdfunding, cashback systems or organize a fund to create the goals with controlling of commitment.
